# Winter Mix
Here lie the innards of [wintermix.kyledecker.me](http://wintermix.kyledecker.me), a small site for built sharing my yearly holiday mixes in the form of 20-song albums.

## Credits

## To-Do
Here are some things I'd like to eventually accomplish:
- Display titles, artists, etc. using ID3 tags rather than filenames
- Implement progress bar for currently playing song, ala Tumblr
- Generate zips from folders rather than storing duplicate audio
- Popup to ask confirmation if someone tries to leave the page while music is playing
- (Possibly) display a global interface for forward/back/track name, etc.
- Add an about/history page
