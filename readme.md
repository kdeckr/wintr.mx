# Wintr.mx
[wintr.mx](http://wintr.mx) is a mini-site I built to share my yearly holiday mixes in the form of 20-song albums.

## Credits
- Inline music handling is thanks to [SoundManager 2](http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/).
- The font used is [Vollkorn](http://vollkorn-typeface.com) by Friedrich Althausen, served using [Google Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts).
- Pinecone sketch drawn by [Ruth Harker](http://doodleaceae.blogspot.fr/2013/10/pine-cone.html).
- Homegrown hosting via [A Small Orange](http://asmallorange.com).

## To-Do
Here are some things I'd like to eventually accomplish:
- Display titles, artists, etc. using ID3 tags rather than filenames
- Implement progress bar for currently playing song, ala Tumblr
- Generate zips from folders rather than storing duplicate audio
- Popup to ask confirmation if someone tries to leave the page while music is playing
- Play/pause status in page title
- (Possibly) display a global interface for forward/back/track name, etc.
- Add an about/history page
