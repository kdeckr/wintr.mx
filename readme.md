# Winter Mix
These are the innards of [wintermix.kyledecker.me](http://wintermix.kyledecker.me), a small site for built sharing my yearly holiday mixes in the form of 20-song albums.

## Features
Here's what I would like to accomplish in constructing this site with [Liam](https://github.com/babymango):
- HTML5 audio player that plays through each album, compatible in all modern browsers
- Tracklist and album information read from ~~ID3 tags~~ filenames, not coded manually
- Responsive scaling to support all devices
- Apt animations for all transitions of states
- Efficient code use and quick load times

## Thanks!
Please listen, share, and support the artists you enjoy. Once the site is live, of course.
