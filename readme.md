> Hi friends,

> Here you'll find 120 tunes that I've put together over the past 6 years. They're my attempts to find new expressions of sound for winter and its many celebrations.

> The last title on this year's mix is the black national anthem, *Lift Every Voice and Sing*. Itâ€™s a tribute to the countless lives lost to racism and injustice, and a reminder of the feats possible when we [raise our voices as one](http://youtu.be/cwWhu8tw4nU).

> Remember to hug, to dance, to sing, to love. If you have time, [share your thoughts](https://www.facebook.com/kdeckr) about this project. And as always... please [support](http://www.donationconspiracy.org) the artists that you enjoy. *Happy winter.*

> Love, Kyle

## To-Do
Here are some things I'd like to eventually accomplish:
- Display titles, artists, etc. using ID3 tags rather than filenames
- Implement progress bar for currently playing song, ala Tumblr
- ~~Generate zips from folders rather than storing duplicate audio~~ Too resource-heavy; easier to just store dupes
- Popup to ask confirmation if someone tries to leave the page while music is playing
- Play/pause status in page title
- (Possibly) display a global interface for forward/back/track name, etc.
- Add an about/history page
